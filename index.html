            <p> Map Plus is a Christian based organization (LDS) focus on sharing the Gospel of Jesus Christ, uplifting
                the needy, we believe that in this afflicted world we can stand by each other to glow ourselves through
                the little we have, Map Plus is a Libeia based Organization and is dedicated to improving lives through
                the little obtain for better enhancements, we have seen and it's indeed obvious that many people
                face alot in today's world, they're also lost from the Gospel of the Savior Jesus Christ and there
                should be something done to affect the society positively
                We believe that this fruit of life as mention in the 1 Nehpi(Book of Mormon) that the Prophet Lehi had a
                dream of can be brought to the knowledge of every lost sheeps to build the Lord's Kingdom and strengthen
                Zion. Imagine of the peculair attributes of the Savior retoring his Church through the Prophet JOSEPH
                SMITH. This shows that he loves us and do not intend to see us in bondage.

            <p> Bringing Light to the World!. Helping in the work of Salvation to have a proper understanding of the
                Restored Gospel
                As a Followers of Christ, we aim proving aid to the best of our eligibilty to bless the lives of others.
                We learned from 3 Nephi 13:1 that "Verily I say unto you, I would you do arms unto the needy". This is a
                commandment from our Heavenly father and that's for sure.
